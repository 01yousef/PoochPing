<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

<p align="justify">
PoochPing (my mom's name for it and I can't think of anything better yet)  
should be a native app, easily installed and used by anyone, anywhere, 
and will be very basic in terms of what it will do and why. <br /><br />
When a user chooses to take their four-legged friend for an outing 
and allowing access to their location, and I feel the app should only 
be granted access while activated by the user, PoochPing will use this 
similarly to how runner apps are used to track progress and accurately 
track their live location, and at the same time calculate the distance 
between them and other users. This is used in conjunction with the color 
collar system to determine if the user should receive a push notification 
to alert them of a potential trigger for their dog, whether the other 
user has a smaller breed which your dog should avoid, a nervous dog 
that you need to be considerate of, or if the dog is listed as 
"non-friendly" and all in the area need to practice a safe social distance. 
<p/>

<p/>

<p align="justify">
The color collar system is a tagging system to assign specific markers 
to the user so others can clearly see which group their dog belongs to 
and allow for quick decision-making that can help prevent incidents 
between both dogs and owners. I have tried to avoid words and colors 
which may negatively label certain traits and try to be as inclusive 
and respectful to each group. The term "non-friendly" and playful 
colors which are the general colors of dog toys have been used to try 
to accomplish a polite tagging system.

<p/>

<p align="justify">
I do understand that these colors may not appeal to all and will 
develop a 'dark theme' as well as a colorblind-friendly icon system 
to ensure all can use it and avoid any miscommunication within the 
app itself.

Thank you for your interest in my application. <br />
I was excited to receive the challenge and realized that it was a good
opportunity to try something new, this project was the first time
using Javascript, and the first time building a website. So I will
admit the challenge has been, well a bit challenging and the code is a
bit rough in some parts, kind of like an old dog toy stuffed and
stitched with what was available to keep it intact, but functional...
sort of.

With that said, I would appreciate any feedback on how I could better this project as I intend to complete it even if my application is unsuccessful.
