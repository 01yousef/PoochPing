          Thank you for your interest in my application. <br />
          I was excited to receive the challenge and realized that it was a good
          opportunity to try something new, this project was the first time
          using Javascript, and the first time building a website. So I will
          admit the challenge has been, well a bit challenging and the code is a
          bit rough in some parts, kind of like an old dog toy stuffed and
          stitched with what was available to keep it intact, but functional...
          sort of. <br />

          With that said, I would appreciate any feedback on how I could better
          this project as

          I intend to complete it even if my application is unsuccessful.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Ever take your canine companion for a nice relaxing day at the beach,
          spend the afternoon at the local park, or just go out for a quick
          stroll around the block? If you're a dog owner you might have said yes
          to more than one of those, and you've probably had at least one of
          those experiences be less than relaxing; having your dog run up to
          some kids at the beach and worried the parents will see your sweet
          Fido as a hellhound and beat him back, or you have had a random dog
          bolting straight for yours at the park and you can already see the vet
          bill burning a hole in your wallet or having to pass another pet
          parent and their pooch pass you on a narrow sidewalk which normally
          would be fine... But their teacup size pup is starting to look like a
          chew toy in the eyes of your hound. <br /><br />
          Sometimes these outings can lead to heartbreaking incidents that could
          have been avoided, either someone assumes that their dog is friendly
          and so yours must be too, or your dog is given a bad name for how they
          look rather than who they are. And while trying to protect someone
          else's furbaby from yours can be seen as uncalled for hostility, or in
          some situations a dog might not get to go and have the same
          experiences like getting to the park because it is the "safer" option
          or similar compromises. <br /><br />
          At the end of the day, the dog's personality is not the problem,
          miscommunication, and assumptions. All dog owners know their dog, the
          problem is no one else does. Your dog might be a social butterfly and
          want to say hello to everyone and every dog, or maybe they play rough
          and get mislabelled as aggressive, or just need some time to warm up
          to others... and just like how some people don't like other people,
          some dogs don't like other dogs, and that's okay. <br /><br />
          So having identified communication as the problem, the next issue is
          how can you tell other pet parents about your pooch's personality
          without being close enough to sniff one another and not having to bark
          from across the park?

          <p>
            You're more likely to find someone who owns a smartphone than
            someone who has a dog, so to tackle our problem of miscommunication
            a mobile app which allows users to see which dogs are at the park
            and have a quick read of their personalities and gauge how well your
            dog will get along with them, or receive a notification of another
            dog coming around the corner and others can view your profile and
            know how best to respect your dog's space and time outside.
            <br /><br />
            The purpose of the app is prevention. Being able to clearly see that
            a dog is "non-friendly" or that they don't play well with smaller
            children or dogs, or having something able to check your blindspot
            can make the difference between life and death, in some cases. To
            better explain all this I have created a demo of how the app should
            look and function in more detail which you can find in the How does
            it work section.

            At this point, you might be wondering why I have chosen to help the
            canine community with this issue. <br /><br />
            My background is a bit peculiar working with Geographical Infomation
            Systems and also in training service dogs, so this project is a
            blending of the two fields. But the real inspiration for this app
            came from thinking back to when I worked at the KSIA in Durban,
            South Africa as an explosive-detection dog handler with my partner,
            K9 Diesel, a massive male Dutch Shepherd who was trained for both
            detection and apprehension.

            He was a big boy with a bigger bite... but also a sucker for
            attention. He would love to say hello to everyone working at the
            airline check-in counters, but because of his breed and size, most
            would panic and try to scare him off. Labeled as aggressive based
            solely on his appearance, no one took into consideration that as a
            certified working dog he had been trained to do well around new
            people. However, on our days off when I would take him to the beach,
            it was the total opposite. Many people would walk their dogs
            off-leash and let them run up to strangers and other dogs. This
            terrified me as Diesel was not fond of other dogs, especially small
            ones. I always had a leash on him, but a leash doesn't do much for
            the other dog running free. <br /><br />
            After reading the briefing and looking for "someone" to help, Diesel
            and other dogs like him seemed to be the perfect fit. And my coding
            background was purely from working with GIS and ESRI products such
            as ArcGIS in Python. Which after these three weeks, I realized was
            very limited and I depended heavily on the tools ESRI provided. So
            for the application and reading in the emails how important it is to
            learn rather than just showcase existing abilities I decided to try
            to learn how to program in JavaScript, build a webpage in HTML and
            CSS and create a functional map without ArcGIS. This website and the
            demo included are very basic and somewhat primitive, but I hope you
            can see potential in the work presented to you and appreciate the
            project for what it is as well as what it can and will be.
